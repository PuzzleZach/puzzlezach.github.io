## Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One

Frogware has an extensive history with the Sherlock IP, creating stunningly detailed cases that require more wit to solve than you might think. Their games put accessibility first, with options to skip challenging puzzles or sections that diverge from the main gameplay. Most importantly, they pay homage to the details that make mysteries great with their detective systems.

### Sherlock and Scope

For our sake, we’re calling this game S1. It is the first truly open-world game in the franchise, with an entire island built from scratch rather than building off the established areas of London. The Frogware team packed in an in-depth disguise system that influences your dialogue with various classes of the island along with a plethora of collectibles and locations to explore in and out of your cases. 

Speaking of cases, S1 totes almost 40 cases including the DLC. The amount of content creates a scope that causes teams to struggle with providing both continuous quality and keeping players engaged. To address this, they created a brilliant motivation for players to hunt for “coins” hidden around the entire island. 

Starting off, there are just 10 coins to find which is a far cry away from games that have 100+ collectibles to track down. Each coin mini-case has a note hidden at its start location with relevance to the story and Sherlock’s relationship with his brother. From there you navigate around the city following the hints to piece together where the coin is actually hidden. This skill is essential when it comes to starting most cases in the game, as you have to quickly ascertain where they are on your map and find your way around the city. 

### Quality Cuts

What systems would I cut from this game to hone its edge? To put it flatly, this is the most accessible Sherlock title and appeals to the broadest player base. We have to examine which systems empower the most players and which are only used by a fringe few.

The first feature on our cutting block is the photo system. You might not remember it, but you can bring up a camera to take photos of very specific pieces of evidence. The camera is used in only a handful of the few dozen cases and just for small pieces of evidence that could have been replaced by a photo from an inspector on the scene. An alternative approach to this system could have been requiring accurate photos of each piece of evidence for cataloging it, but that would be for more devout players.

The second feature is the ambitious world design -- even with the cornucopia of content so much time is spent running about unless you are fast traveling. The northern part of Miner’s End and all of Silverton could have been combined together to create a more gradual “working class” zone. The Old City could have also been shrunk down, with some parts of Scaladio being absorbed into it to show the culture clash occurring on a daily basis. 

With this smaller world, we can begin tweaking the faction system: moving the military faction into working class along with vagabonds, leaving criminals as its own distinct faction, and splitting Ottomans into the above classes -- leaving police untouched. To recap we are now left with:

- Nobles (Including Ottomans)

- Working class, sailors, lesser fortunate

- Police

- Criminals
 
This enables us to create disguises that more easily impact multiple groups at once and leave less guesswork to the player as they jump between outfits trying to get information. 

### Summary

Just a few strategic cuts to the scope of S1 can increase its appeal to casual gamers and create a more immersive experience as players are encouraged to traverse by foot rather than teleporting around and can engage with citizens far more easily. With less systems to focus on for the player, they become far more familiar with the investigation systems and improve their deduction skills. 

These are just my short thoughts on some of the systems in Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, which I felt was the pinnacle of the franchise. I would absolutely love to dive deeper into it’s narratives another time and would adore the opportunity to explore the island again in a future game.
