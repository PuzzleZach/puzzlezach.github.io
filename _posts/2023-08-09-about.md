Hey there! I'm Zach, I'm entering my 4th year in the tech industry as a generalist programmer with an emphasis on providing custom solutions to startups. Iâ€™m interested in game development, with a focus on systems and technical design. 

This "about me" section will be expanding later on but for now:

### 2023 Goals
- [ ] Read "Doom Guy"
- [ ] Publish a game using Godot
- [ ] Convert my Unity projects to UE BluePrints
