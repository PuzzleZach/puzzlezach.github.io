Hey!

I'm Zach, a seasoned tech professional with 4+ years of experience. My background is in providing custom programming solutions for startups. I'm particularly passionate about systems design, constantly devising process enhancements and optimizing user-system interactions. I apply these thoughts to my game development projects with a focus on technical design. 

This "about me" section will be expanding later on but for now:
