## Wolfenstein: The New Order

Hey everyone, this is going to be a short overview of the gun systems in Wolfenstein: The New Order and my thoughts on how they improve the gameplay experience, along with some ways they guide the player in experimenting with various weapons. 

The game starts in an alternate universe in the 1940s, so the first few weapons you are exposed to are what a player would expect. They have a sub-machine gun which they use in close quarters in the trenches before picking up an automatic rifle from defeated enemy soldiers. Right off the bat the player has 3 basic styles to switch between and the design of the trenches alternatives between long corridors requiring the use of the rifle and short connecting trenches or bunkers where picking a close-quarters weapon is more reliable. 

As the player explores the first map they pick up a pistol and an upgrade for it, the silencer. It is not originally explained to the player that upgrades persist throughout future levels, but the silencer allows you to move through most of the map without causing any alarms to trigger. Grenades are also plentiful and can make clearing out entrenched enemies a breeze, which helps build out skill upgrades that can be used across playthroughs.

Most maps have the player start off with just their knife or 1 other weapon, requiring them to scavenge weapons from the environment or defeated enemies. As their weapon wheel fills up they can rotate through their weapons to exhaust different ammo types or handle any situation that comes up. The most interesting feature of this system is the dual-wield option which doubles damage output at the expense of ammunition and accuracy.

Ammo is plentiful throughout the levels, tucked away inside wooden crates which can be destroyed or thin-metal boxes which can be cut open by the laser gun. The laser gun quickly becomes a staple in gameplay, used for solving puzzles and blasting enemies. The alternate fire modes also increase the options: from the silenced pistol mentioned earlier to rocket launchers on the rifle, ricochet bullets from the shotgun, and the marksman rifle having a laser mode of its own. 

Between dual-wielding and alternate fire, the gun systems in Wolfenstein give players the tools they need to play their way whether fast and frenzied or slow and measured. The perk system rewards players for the style they enjoy most, dishing out magazine upgrades, increased benefits for stealthy approaches, and faster reloads. Once again, the underlying *id tech* showcased the best of its abilities thanks to the design and vision of MachineGames.
