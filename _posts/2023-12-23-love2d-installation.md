This is a quick guide on installing LOVE2D for [CS50G]("https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/"), offered by Harvard. It took me a few tries and different articles, but I found the quickest way to set up your environment to run the projects from the course on a Windows machine.

1. Go to https://love2d.org/#download and pick the 32-bit or 64-bit installer.
2. Run the executable and install it wherever.
3. Take the LOVE executable, which appears under "recently added" when you click on the Windows Icon, and drag it to your CS50G folder.
4. This creates a LOVE shortcut where all your projects are.
5. Click on any project, like "pong", and drag the folder on top of the LOVE executable.
6. This will run the project without needing to set up Lua or make any changes in your terminal.


Again, this might seem simple but I have not found a cohesive and succint guide for this yet. Happy coding. ðŸ™‚
